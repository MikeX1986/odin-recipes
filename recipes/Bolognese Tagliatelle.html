        <p>Combine it with tagliatelle or with your favorite pasta to create a satiny,
        <p>creaminess from the pasta starches that make this a memorable meal.</p>  
        <p><em>Serve with a loaf of crusty Italian bread.</em></p>
        </h2>

            <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
            <li>½ cup dry white wine</li>
            <li>1 (28 ounce) can San Marzano whole peeled tomatoes, drained</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>

            <li>1 (16 ounce) box tagliatelle pasta</li>
            <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>COOKING STEPS</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Cook pancetta in a pan over medium heat until it has released its fat and is crisp,</p>
                <p>7 to 8 minutes. Add carrots, celery, and onions and cook until the vegetables soften and the onions are translucent,</p> 
                 7 to 8 minutes.Set aside.</li>

            <li><p>Heat olive oil in a 4-quart pot over medium heat. Break ground beef and pork into small chunks and add them to the pot</p>
                <p>cook, stirring lightly, until browned, 7 to 8 minutes.</p></li>

            <li><p>Stir the pancetta-vegetable mixture into the ground meat.</p>
                <p>Add wine.</p>
                <p>Reduce heat to medium-low and stir, breaking up the meat until finely ground, wine has evaporated,</p>
                <p> and the pot is almost dry, 13 to 15 minutes.</p>
                <p>Add tomatoes, nutmeg, salt, and red pepper.</p> 
                <p>Use the back of a spoon to break up the tomatoes and continue to break down the meat mixture into very small bits,</p> 
                <p>about 5 minutes.</p></li>

            <li><p>Pour beef stock and heavy cream into the pot and reduce heat to the lowest setting.</p>
                <p>Leave to simmer, partially covered, stirring occasionally, for at least 2 hours.</p></li>
            
            <li><p>Meanwhile, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil.</p>
                <p>Cook tagliatelle at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes.</p>
                <p>Reserve 1 cup of pasta water and drain well.</p></li>
            <li><p>Stir pasta into the Bolognese sauce and mix well, adding a little reserved pasta water </p>
                <p>if needed to develop a satiny coating.</p>
                <p><em>Top with grated Parmesan cheese.</em></p></li>
        </ol>
