        <h2><p>'Cordon Bleu' is a French term, literally translated as 'blue ribbon',</p></h2>
            <p>Originally referred to an award for culinary excellence given to women cooks! </p>
            <p>The term can now apply to any superior cook (yes, men too), and also to this dish (chicken, </p> 
            <p>ham and Swiss cheese slices, breaded and sauteed).</p>
            <p>This yummy version adds paprika and a creamy white wine sauce worthy of its own blue ribbon.</p>
